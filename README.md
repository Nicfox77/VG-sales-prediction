# VG-sales-prediction

ðŸ“Œ Introduction
In this project, we aim to predict the global sales performance of video games using various game attributes. Our goal is to develop a regression model that can estimate global sales (in millions of units) based on features like platform, genre, publisher, year of release, and other relevant charasteristiics. We will utilize a dataset containing historical sales data and game attributes to train our model.
